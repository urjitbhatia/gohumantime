A human readable time translator in golang

# Motivation
Use a simple human readable string representation of time
Inspired by: https://github.com/rschmukler/human-interval

# Benchmarks
```
  Slowest iteration is faster than 500 ns (Benchmark test fails if it takes more than 500 ns)
  2000 samples of ToMilliseconds("4 seconds, 2 minutes 1 hour and 3 days and 10weeks, 1 month and 1 year"):
      runtime:
        Fastest Time: 0.000s
        Slowest Time: 0.000s
        Average Time: 0.000s Â± 0.000s
```
